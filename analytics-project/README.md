# Analytics Service

## Architecture Overview

Our analytics service is designed to handle large-scale payloads with high performance and reliability. The system implements the **Materialization Pattern** to optimize for both write throughput and read performance and **Eventual Consistency** to prioritize system availability over strong consistency guarantees.

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables

- **`pages`**: Stores page metadata with unique page names
- **`page_views`**: Stores raw analytics data with timestamps and view counts
- **`page_views_report`**: Materialized view that joins pages with analytics data

### Materialization Pattern Implementation

#### 1. Write-Optimized Tables

The base tables (`pages` and `page_views`) are designed for high-frequency writes:

- **`pages`**: Simple lookup table for page metadata
- **`page_views`**: Optimized for bulk inserts with composite index on `(name, date, hour)`
- No complex joins or aggregations during writes

#### 2. Materialized View for Read Optimization

The `page_views_report` materialized view implements the materialization pattern:

- **Pre-computed Results**: Joins and aggregations are pre-calculated
- **Optimized Indexes**: Composite indexes on common query patterns
- **Fast Read Access**: Eliminates runtime joins for analytics queries
- **Consistent Structure**: Predictable data format for reporting

## Service Architecture

### 1. Increments Service

**Purpose**: Handles real-time analytics data ingestion

**Responsibilities**:

- Accepts page view increment requests
- Updates `pages` table (upsert page metadata)
- Updates `page_views` table (increment view counts)
- Optimized for high-frequency, low-latency writes

**Key Features**:

- Write-only access to base tables
- Minimal processing overhead
- Designed for horizontal scaling

### 2. The Wolf Service

**Purpose**: Maintains the materialized view for optimal read performance

**Responsibilities**:

- Periodically refreshes `page_views_report` materialized view
- Ensures data consistency between tables and view
- Handles view optimization and maintenance

**Key Features**:

- Scheduled refresh every X minutes
- Background processing to avoid blocking writes
- Maintains read performance for analytics queries

### 3. Analytics Service

**Purpose**: Provides analytics data through predefined filters

**Responsibilities**:

- Queries only the `page_views_report` materialized view
- Provides filtered analytics data
- Handles complex reporting queries

**Key Features**:

- Read-only access to optimized materialized view
- Fast response times for analytics queries

## Materialization Pattern Benefits

### Write Performance

- **Separation of Concerns**: Write operations only touch optimized base tables
- **Minimal Locking**: No complex joins during writes

### Read Performance

- **Pre-computed Joins**: Materialized view eliminates runtime joins
- **Optimized Indexes**: Composite indexes on common query patterns
- **Consistent Structure**: Predictable data format for analytics
- **Cached Results**: Materialized view acts as a read cache

### Scalability

- **Service Isolation**: Each service can scale independently
- **Database Optimization**: Write-optimized tables + read-optimized views
- **Background Processing**: View updates don't block user operations
- **Horizontal Distribution**: Services can be deployed across multiple instances

### Trade-off Decision

- **Availability First**: System remains available even during materialized view updates
- **Stale Data Tolerance**: Analytics queries may return slightly outdated data (up to X minutes old)
- **No Blocking Operations**: Write operations never wait for view synchronization
- **Background Synchronization**: The Wolf service updates the materialized view asynchronously

### Benefits of Eventual Consistency

- **High Availability**: System never goes down due to view refresh operations
- **Better Performance**: No blocking operations during writes or reads
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can operate independently without coordination
- **Fault Tolerance**: Partial failures don't cascade across the entire system
